            <p>According to The United Nations World Water Development Report 2018, the global demand for water has been increasing at a rate of about 1% per year as a function of population growth, economic development and changing consumption patterns, among other factors, and it will continue to grow significantly over the next two decades. An estimated 3.6 billion people (nearly half the global population) live in areas that are potentially water-scarce at least one month per year, and this population could increase to some 4.8-5.7 billion by 2050. The population currently affected by land degradation/desertification and drought is estimated at 1.8 billion people, making this the most significant category of ‘natural disaster’ based on mortality and socio-economic impact relative to gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. Many countries are already undergoing pervasive water scarcity conditions and will likely have to cope with lower surface water resources availability in the 2050s. At present, almost all countries in a belt around 10 to 40 degrees north, from Mexico to China and to Southern Europe are affected by water scarcity, together with Australia, Western South America and Southern Africa in the Southern Hemisphere (Veldkamp et al., 2017). Throughout the early-mid 2010s, about 1.9 billion people (27% of the global population) lived in potential severely water-scarce areas and in 2050 this could increase to some 2.7-3.2billion.</p>
            <p>Africa’s share of global fresh water resources is 10% and closely matches its share of world population at 12%, however, the distribution of this resource is uneven especially in areas of severe aridity like the Sahara and Sahel in the north and the Kalahari in the south (Network of African Science Academies, 2014).Rapid population increase, inappropriate water governance and institutional arrangements, depletion of water resources through pollution, environmental degradation, deforestation, and low and unsustainable financing of investments in water supply and sanitation are some of the main threats that pose challenges to the management of water resources on the continent.</p>
            <p>According to the Development Initiatives 2018, Kenya is a water-scarce country with an estimated total renewable water resource per capita of 692m3 per year against the recommended minimum of 1,000m3 per capita per year. It’s renewable water resource per capita is projected to fall below the absolute water scarcity level of 500m3 per year by 2030 due to population growth and poor sanitation is estimated to cost Kenya’s economy Ksh27 billion annually. Access to water from an improved source has increased substantially between 2009 and 2015/16 at the</p>
            <p>national level, but rural areas are still left behind. High incidence of poverty, especially in the northern counties, prevents access to safe water and improved sanitation services. The cost of accessing water from an improved source such as piped water is a barrier to poor households where there are no pro-poor tariffs. Kenya is facing a huge resource gap (Ksh1.2 trillion) that may negatively affect its ability to achieve universal access to safe water and improved sanitation services by 2030. In addition, investment in pro-poor water and sanitation projects is still heavily reliant on donor contributions.</p>
            <p>In Turkana County, 39% of residents use improved sources of water, with the rest relying on unimproved sources (Access to water in Turkana County, 2019). Turkana South constituency has the highest share of residents using improved sources of water at 56%. Lodwar township ward has the highest share of residents using improved sources of water at 77% with Loima having the lowest.</p>
