It does not only create opportunities for active participation in development but also builds solidarity and trust, lasting friendship or relationship between the volunteers and the beneficiaries.<br>A considerable number of our works are undertaken by volunteers to fill the gaps of employment in the organisation. We value our volunteers and treat them with high esteem.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Please, consider Volunteering with us to fight hunger, poverty and violence &#8230;in the rural areas. By sharing your time, knowledge and skills, you help to make a big positive difference in the lives of the poorest, the oppressed and the disadvantaged people in the rural areas.<br>For volunteering arrangements, feel free to contact us at\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:partnership[at]sorudeo.org.ug\">info@rihakenya.org<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Urgent volunteer opportunities<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pro pono Lawyers and Legal aid advocates<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The need for legal services among the poorest, the oppressed and the disadvantaged people in the rural areas is overwhelming. According to our survey, there are a big number of widows and other vulnerable women including children whose properties are being seized unjustly by irresponsible people every year. This is just a single case among others. These disadvantaged people cannot afford a lawyer to represent them in court.<br>Please, volunteer with us to help these disadvantaged women, children and other persons in need to attain justice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Online Fundraisers<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We believe that online fundraising is a powerful tool to raise funds for our activities and yet it is no easy task if not planned properly. It takes a good preparation, creativity and patience. You can help us meet our fundraising needs; contact us to volunteer in our online fundraising campaign.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Projects Designers and Projects writers<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have great work in our secretariat, more especially on planning and designing projects. Our Gender &amp; Projects Officer is in need of help in the field of projects planning and management. Your contributions like an architect in projects&#8217; planning will help our projects to get down quickly, efficiently, safely and successfully.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>VolunteerismVolunteerism is one of the most powerful means of engaging people in tackling development challenges.
